Goal: decouple Material from GameObject

> So I think the issue currently is the mapped memory
  for the uniformBuffers on the Material. We need mapped
  memory per object.

  It's possible to pass an offset to vkCmdBindDescriptorSets.

  Maybe material could keep a reference count, and define offset
  on the game object it's getting used for?
